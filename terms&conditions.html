      <p>2.3) All users are not allowed to apply for withdrawal in the middle of a task to avoid affecting the merchant's operation.</p>
      <p>2.4) Users' funds are completely safe on the platform and the platform will be liable for any accidental loss.</p>

      <p>3.5) If you forget your password, you can reset it by contacting the online service and be sure to change it yourself afterwards.</p>
      <p>4) Optimization ratings are randomly assigned by the system and therefore cannot be changed, canceled, controlled, or skipped in any way.</p>

      <p>5) Legal action will be taken in the event of misuse of the account.</p>

      <p>7) The platform will not be held responsible for any deposits made to the wrong detail.</p>
      <p>8) Each time the product data is optimized, the user must complete it within 24 hours. If it is not completed and the merchant is not notified to apply for an extension, resulting in complaints from the merchant, the user will be responsible for breach of contract and may have his or her credit score deducted.</p>
